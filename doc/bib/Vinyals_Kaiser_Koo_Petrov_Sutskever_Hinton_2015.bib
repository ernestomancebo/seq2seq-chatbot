@article{Vinyals_Kaiser_Koo_Petrov_Sutskever_Hinton_2015, title={Grammar as a Foreign Language}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449}, abstractNote={Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural language processing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering for decades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.}, note={arXiv: 1412.7449}, journal={arXiv:1412.7449 [cs, stat]}, author={Vinyals, Oriol and Kaiser, Lukasz and Koo, Terry and Petrov, Slav and Sutskever, Ilya and Hinton, Geoffrey}, year={2015}, month={Jun} }
